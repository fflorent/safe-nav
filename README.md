# Safe-nav

This is an experimental [sweet.js](http://sweetjs.org) macro
that implements [existential accessor operator](http://coffeescript.org/#try:a%3F.b()%3F.c%0A%0Aif%20a%3F.b()%3F.c%0A%20%20d()) (aka "?.") of CoffeeScript
or the [Safe-Navigation](http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GROOVY/Operators#Operators-SafeNavigationOperator%28%3F.%29) operator of Groovy.

So you can easily change a piece of code of this type:

````js
if (parent) {
  var child = parent.querySelector(".class");
  if (child)
    child.remove();
}
````

to

````js
parent?.querySelector(".class")?.remove();
````

Simpler, isn't it?

## Installing

````bash
$ npm install sweet.js safe-nav
````

## Using

````bash
$ sjs -m safe-nav -o compiled.js my_sweet_code.js
````

If you pass -c to sjs along with -o output.js, it will generate a sourcemap so you get good debugging too!
